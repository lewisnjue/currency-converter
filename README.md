# Currency Converter (Android, Java)

Simple Android app (Java-only) that converts between a few currencies using hard-coded rates.

How to open and run
- Open the `currency-converter` folder in Android Studio.
- Let Android Studio sync Gradle and download dependencies.
- Build and run on an emulator or device (min SDK 21).

Notes
- The app uses a small hard-coded rate table in `MainActivity.java`. You can update `RATES_TO_USD` with live rates or extend the list of currencies.
- Implemented using only Java (no Kotlin).
